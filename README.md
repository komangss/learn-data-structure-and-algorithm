Hello this is my repository i used for learning Data Structure and Algorithm using Java :)

**Why We Need To Learn Data Structures and Algorithm?**
> Data structures and algorithms (DSA) goes through solutions to standard problems in detail and gives you an insight into how efficient it is to use each one of them. It also teaches you the science of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. This enables you to choose the best of various choices.
